# Pneumonia-X-Ray-Image-Classification
Image Classification with tensorflow
Written in python with the help of libraries like numpy, openCV, tensorflow, pandas. The data set was collected from the link 
https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. The dataset was split into training and test set by the dataset provider. The training set was trained by using 
CNN (neural network which works best for image data) and hence the model was developed. The train accuracy of 97% and the test accuracy of 96% was obtained. This model takes 
in input image of size (80x80x3) and predicts whether the X-ray has pneumonia or not.
